      <h2><span class="nfglyph">&#xe21c </span>The New Bonsai Linux</h2>
      <h3><i>2022 - current</i></h3>
        The New Bonsai Linux is a lean desktop experience on a rolling-release Ubuntu core. The core ethos of bonsai is "cultivate the branches you want and make something beautiful", and due to the core application, distrobox's slick system-integration you can cultivate full Debian, Arch, or Fedora experiences, out of the box, or graft on any distribution you prefer, such as Alpine Linux (fittingly). This evolved directly out of another project on my GitHub, kpopdesktop, to bring the KDE/Plasma experience to Pop_OS! as a way to really test my linux-fu after a decade experience administering Linux systems. The .ISO file is available upon request, however, unfortunately, it is not a live environment distro.
        <ul>
          <li>Rolling Release Ubuntu: powered by the same deb-src tweaks that power Rhino Linux</li>
          <li>Seemless integration: apt, dnf, pacman, aur, nala, flatpak, homebrew, pacstall, deb-get, and pip. Custom whole-system update tool: bonsai-update.</li>
