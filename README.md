# Startpage

This is my startpage, forked from [voxie12/moon](https://github.com/voxie12/moon) once upon a time. Since then I've started playing around with the HTML and CSS a little bit, and I like this more. I am still keeping their JS for the time/date, though. That's all that's left at this point.

I'm clearly pretty new at HTML and CSS, but I like this. Plays nice with a bunch of different sizes and positions.
